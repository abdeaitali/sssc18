Hackathon for Summer school smart city 2018 (SSSC18)

## What: main idea/concept
A trip planner that provides "comfortable" travel paths (comfortable means with no disruptions or potential delays).

## How
We use APis from Trafiklab providing information about travel paths and disruptions. Combining these two sets of information, we clear up the disrupted paths and provide "comfortable" travel paths.

## Where
This simple application is valid for the Swedish public transport system, i.e. large cities such as Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö.

## When
The applicatin can be used to plan your trip and avoid disruptions.
